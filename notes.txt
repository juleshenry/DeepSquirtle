Scraping 09/11/19:
- which are the hazard spells?
    j: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes
- do we use games that aren't rated? (might be experimental / taken less seriously)
    j/h: probably not
    -- BUT sometimes (i have found) games are not rated but are tournament games, therefore still taken seriously
- why do some games not have 6 pokemon? (should probably get rid of these?)
    j: yes remove
- should we include individual player elo? (games are in theory matched evenly so probably won't find too much here?)
    j: could be an influence in outcome, so worthy!

- how should we value the type effectiveness of teams?

DataExpansion 10/20/19
- low elo games have an inverse correlation between mean stats and game outcome... why?
- high elo games are nearly uncorrelated
