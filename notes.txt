Scraping:
- which are the hazard spells?
- do we use games that aren't rated? (might be experimental / taken less seriously)
    -- BUT sometimes (i have found) games are not rated but are tournament games, therefore still taken seriously
- why do some games not have 6 pokemon? (should probably get rid of these?)
- should we include individual player elo? (games are in theory matched evenly so probably won't find too much here?)
